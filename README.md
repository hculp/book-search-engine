# MERN: Book Search Engine

![Github License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

This is an example of a book search engine that has been refactured from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with ApolloServer. It is built using MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Check the appropriate files and file structure to compare and contrast utility from a typical RESTful API with this ApolloServer based MERN stack.

The site allows users to search for books through Google Books API, which they can save books they're interested in to their saved books page after registering/login. Users can remove saved books in case they added the wrong book or is no longer needed. When users search a book, a max of 10 results is shown to choose from to select from, so refining the search query may be necessary to find a specific book/edition. The book card details presented show a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
